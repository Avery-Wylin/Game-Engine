# Game-Engine
This is a project is to help learn GLSL, OGL, the technicalities of 3D graphics, and to have general fun and practice. I decided to save this project to Github for safe keeping and version management. This project uses basic Light Weight Java Game Library 3 (LWJGL3) and Java Open Math Library (JOML).
